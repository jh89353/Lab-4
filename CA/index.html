			THE PITCHFORK DISNEY by PHILIP RIDLEY
			OCT 30th - Nov 9th / Weds to Sat / 6:30pm 
			Upstairs Chaplains Pub, D2</a></h1>

<h2>
We’d like to introduce ourselves:
Judder Theatre was founded in 2018.  We are a theatre company based in Dublin City Centre.  Having moved from our former location at Doyle’s Pub due to renovation works, 
we are currently based at Chaplin’s Bar, Hawkins St., Dublin 2.  
Whilst we are relative newcomers on the pub theatre scene, founding members Shaun Elebert and Vincent Patrick both have a wealth of experience in acting, 
directing and stagecraft going back many years including roles in RTE’s The Clinic and Fair City and productions in the West End. 
Together with our in-house writer Patricia Browne, Judder Theatre are committed to promoting new writing as well as championing existing plays 
with our dynamic and intimate theatrical productions. As inclusivity is an important part of our ethos, 
we offer a professional theatrical experience for a lower ticket price - widening our audience participation in this art form and ensuring that Irish theatre 
remains vibrant and relevant.
