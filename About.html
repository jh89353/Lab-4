		<h2>Welcome to Judder Theatre Company. We are a Dublin based Pub Theatre Company. We formed in 2018 with Shaun Elebert 
			taking the helm as Artistic Director along with co-founders Vincent Patrick and Patricia Browne. 
		From the very outset our aim has been to make accessible work for all audiences, with their experience at the heart of our work and artistic planning. 
		We principally aim to engage young and adult audiences, along with first-time attendees, encouraging the next generation
		of theatre goers by providing dynamic and diverse productions
		Although Judder Theatre receives no public subsidy, it has managed to put together an inspiring team of creative and passionate folk
		who strive to bring our audiences the best possible theatrical experience in the most intimate of spaces. 
		Judder Theatre  believe in daring and distinctive programming and are committed to providing a place for audiences to explore big ideas in small surroundings.
		We nurture and develop new projects to present a mix of new writing, modern gems and re-imagined classics. 
		<br>
		Currently based Upstairs at Chaplains Bar, Judder theatre stages in-house productions under the direction of Artistic Director Shaun Elebert. 
		Productions for 2019 include The Bear by Anton Checkov directed by Shaun Elebert; A Little Cloud by Patricia Browne 
		(Adapted from the same titled short story in James Joyce’s Dubliners) directed by Vincent Patrick; Eveline by Patricia Browne (Adapted from the same titled short story in 
		James Joyce’s Dubliners) directed by Shaun Elebert; The Pitchfork Disney by Philip Ridley Directed by Shaun Elebert.</h2>
